# Image-Similarity

## Introduction
I had and idea for a project, when I saw the controversy of Apple announcing that they will check Apple users photos and compare them with the pictures in their database of illegal photos(CSAM). After hearing this I was interested in technology and algorithms of matching similar photos. So, I decided to create this project, where I implement different algorithms for finding similar photos.


## Algorithms
<ul>
<li>Perceptual Hashing(Phash)</li>
<li>Average Hashing(Ahash)</li>
<li>Difference Hashing(Dhash)</li>
<li>Wavelet Hashing(Whash)</li>
</ul>


## Data
The data consists of three photos:
<ul>
<li>image1.jpg - Image of Billie Eilish.</li>
<li>image2.jpg - Image of Billie Eilish, with big white blog added.</li>
<li>image3.jpg - Image of Shrek.</li>
</ul>
